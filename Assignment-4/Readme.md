#XML Application

The aim of this assignment is to make sure that you understand and are familiar with the concepts covered in the lectures, including XML elements, attributes, statements, XML schema, XML validation, XML transformation (XSL), and their classes in .Net FCL. By the end of the assignment, you should have applied these concepts and techniques in creating an XML file, its schema, its style sheet, and have written Web services and an SOA application to process these files.
In this assignment, you will create a directory of persons, which can be represented as an XML tree. The diagram below shows required structure of the directory of persons in XML tree notation that you will create in this assignment. All the “Person” elements have the same structure. Notice that different shapes of boxes have different meanings. They represent elements, attributes, and text contents/values, respectively. The structure of element and attributes given in the diagram below are required to implement, while the given text contents/values in the diagram are examples. The Category element can take three content values: Family, Friend, or Work. You can define it as of enumeration type or simply as of string type.
